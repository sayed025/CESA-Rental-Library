# Website of A Rental Library
**Project Description:**  
This is a PHP based web development project for CSE-3100 course of my undergraduate degree. The website is for a library which gives books to the student on rent.  
**Features of the website:**  
1.Users can sign up and login to the website. Users have to verify email for login successfully.If a user sign up as admin other admin have to first approve the request.  
2.Student can see the available books, request for new books and also can delete a requests.User can also edit their profile.They can also return the books and have to pay fine if returned late.  
3.Admin can add new books,approve or reject any requests and also can see the student's information registered on website.  

**Technology:**  
I have used HTML,CSS to design the frontend and I have used PHP and MYSQL for backend.
